# Rationale of this file #

It is a good thing that the packages available through CTAN number in
the thousands, but that means some really... *unexpected* things can
occur when some package loads some other package you're unaware of. To
(try) to make the situation manageable, I list here some of the most
unexpected (at least to me) dependencies.

* biblatex (depends on:)
	- etoolbox (provides `\patchcmd`)

* mathdesign
	- amssymb (provides `\blackquare` for QED symbol)
