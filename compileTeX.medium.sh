###############################################################################
#
# Much like targets in a Makefile, this scripts provides functions to do a
# simple build, a full build, etc, for a LaTeX project.
#
# Three main functions, compile(), small_build(), and big_build():
#
# - compile() just runs the LaTeX compiler on whatever file it is given;
#
# - small_build() runs compile().
#
# - big_build() runs compile() once, then build bibliography etc. (if
# required), and then runs compile() three more times.
#
# Most of the remaining functions revolve around these three, to check for
# errors and give feedback properly, and so on.
#
###############################################################################

###

# Notes:
# - (1) After an unsuccessful compilation, and after fixing the mistake that
#   caused it, a normal compile, in batchmode with halt on errors, will still lead
#   to a natbib error. It goes away after doing another normal compile. But perhaps
#   the best strategy is to do debug mode in case of errors...
