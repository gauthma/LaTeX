\section{Styles, et al.}
Here I’ll describe a way of installing \LaTeX\ styles, BiBTeX styles, and a couple 
of other things in a straightforward way. I think this should work with most 
*nix systems.

The first thing to do, is discover where whatever you want to install should be 
installed. And the ideal way to do this is using a tool named kpsewhich, which 
should get installed when you install LaTeX. It can be used to do a lot of 
things\\(\verb+$ kpsewhich --help+), but the one we’re interested in here, 
location of styles, uses the \verb+--show-path NAME+ option. The list of allowed names 
is part of the output of the \verb+--help+ option. So for instance, to discover where to place 
BiBTeX style files (*.bst), run:
\begin{verbatim}
kpsewhich --show-path bst
\end{verbatim}
This will output a list of locations where BiBTeX style files are searched for. 
So if you have a file called mystyle.bst, create a folder named ``mystyle" in the 
appropriate location (I use \verb+/home/user/texmf/bibtex/bst/+), and put mystyle.bst 
inside the folder you just created. Then run \verb+$ texhash .+ (don’t forget the 
dot!) from the ``appropriate location" folder you used. And you're done!

\section{Math Stuff}
The commands I use for mathematics are included in the file 
\texttt{custom\_commands.tex}.

For spacing: In a ``math'' environment, LaTeX ignores the spaces you type 
and puts in the spacing that it thinks is best. LaTeX formats mathematics the
way it’s done in mathematics texts. If you want different spacing, LaTeX 
provides the following four commands for use in math mode:

\begin{verbatim}
\; - a thick space

\: – a medium space

\, – a thin space

\! – a negative thin space 
\end{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{is-abbrv}
% \bibliography{bib_file}     % for BiBTeX file
\end{document}
