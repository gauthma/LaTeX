      \emph{to explain, one must first understand}. Writing being mostly about 
      the former, it provides a strong incentive to put in the effort needed to 
      achieve the latter. Besides, writing helps one to become a better---and 
      faster!---reader.
    \item The above notwithstanding, he chronically tends to accumulate more (dead-tree type) books than 
      what he is able to read.
