% MATH SPACING
For spacing: In a ``math'' environment, LaTeX ignores the spaces you type and 
puts in the spacing that it thinks is best. LaTeX formats mathematics the
way it’s done in mathematics texts. If you want different spacing, LaTeX 
provides the following four commands for use in math mode: 

\begin{verbatim}
\; - a thick space

\: – a medium space

\, – a thin space

\! – a negative thin space 
  \end{verbatim}

\section{Styles, et al.}
  Here I'll describe a way of installing \LaTeX\ styles, BiBTeX styles, and a couple 
  of other things in a straightforward way---I think this should work with most 
  *nix systems.

  The first thing to do, is discover where whatever you want to install should 
  be installed. And the ideal way to do this is using a tool named kpsewhich, 
  which should get installed when you install LaTeX. It can be used to do a lot 
  of things (\verb+$ kpsewhich --help+), but the one we’re interested in here, 
  location of styles, uses the \verb+--show-path NAME+ option. The list of 
  allowed names is part of the output of the \verb+--help+ option. So for 
  instance, to discover where to place BiBTeX style files (*.bst), run:
  \begin{verbatim}
kpsewhich --show-path bst
  \end{verbatim}

  This will output a list of locations where BiBTeX style files are searched 
  for. So if you have a file called mystyle.bst, create a folder named 
  ``mystyle" in the appropriate location (I use 
  \verb+/home/user/texmf/bibtex/bst/+), and put mystyle.bst inside the folder 
  you just created. Then run \verb+$ texhash .+ (don’t forget the dot!) from the 
  ``appropriate location'' folder you used. And you're done!
