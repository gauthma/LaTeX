# bibliography building and three singles afterwords, respectively. Most of the
# remaining functions build on these two, to compile both the report and its
# unabridged version (only in the case of reports), and to check for errors and
# give feedback properly, and so on.

# Notes:
# - (1) After an unsuccessful compilation, and after fixing the mistake that
#   caused it, a normal run, in batchmode with halt on errors, will still lead
#   to a natbib error. It goes away after doing another normal run. But perhaps
#   the best strategy is to do debug mode in case of errors...
