# give feedback properly, and so on.

# Notes:
# - (1) After an unsuccessful compilation, and after fixing the mistake that
#   caused it, a normal compile, in batchmode with halt on errors, will still lead
#   to a natbib error. It goes away after doing another normal compile. But perhaps
#   the best strategy is to do debug mode in case of errors...
